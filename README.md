## Key Steps in the Project

1. **Data Loading and Inspection** â€“ Understand structure, types, and completeness.
2. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Fill missing numeric and categorical values.
3. **Statistical Analysis** â€“ Generate descriptive stats and correlation matrix.
4. **Outlier Detection** â€“ Use Z-score and visualize with boxplots.
5. **Visualizations**:
   - Line plot for trend analysis
   - Boxplot for outliers
   - Heatmap for correlations
   - Pie & Bar charts for category distributions
   - Scatter & Pair plots for variable relationships
